# A_doubly_linked_list
The ninth laboratory work in the first year of the Faculty of Mathematics of YarSU on the basics of programming in C++

1. Create a structure (or class) NODE (=list node=list item) containing the fields:
KEY (=information stored in the node)
NEXT (=pointer to the next item)
PREVIOUS (=pointer to the previous item)
2. Create a structure (or class) LIST (=doubly linked list) containing fields and methods:
HEAD (=pointer to the first element)
TAIL (=pointer to the last element)
QUANTITY (= number of elements)
Add an element to the beginning
Add an element to the end
Extract the first element
Extract the last element
3. Remove all minimal elements of the list.
4. Implement a method that transforms each element of the sequence.
The pointer to the conversion function is passed as a parameter.
5. Add indexing of elements (redefine the [] operator).
Note. If some fields and methods are not specified, but you think they should
maybe - they need to be written. At the end of the lesson, you need to hand over the work to the teacher.
It is necessary to arrange the work in accordance with the requirements for
laboratory work.
